# Stopwatch Project
This project is a simple stopwatch implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch to track elapsed time.

## Features
- **Start:** Begin counting time from zero.
- **Stop:** Pause the stopwatch at the current elapsed time.
- **Reset:** Clear the stopwatch and set the elapsed time back to zero.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styling of the stopwatch and buttons.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for controlling the stopwatch functionality.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open index.html in your browser:**
   ```
   cd stopwatch-project
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Interact with the stopwatch:**
   - Click **Start** to begin the stopwatch.
   - Click **Stop** to pause the stopwatch.
   - Click **Reset** to clear and reset the stopwatch to zero.

## Future Improvements
- Implement lap functionality to record split times.
- Add styles for a more visually appealing stopwatch interface.
- Allow users to customize the stopwatch (e.g., change colors, add sound effects).
